Here’s are just five of the many good reasons  we think you should vote Labour:
 - __Labour are working for the people rather than their millionaire friends.__  Labour want to increase the minimum wage to £10 an hour for all workers, improve working conditions and provide a tax and benefits system that works for you, not just for millionaires.

 - __Labour will put more money in your pocket.__ As well as boosting the minimum wage, Labour’s economic investment plan will boost industry and provide better jobs across the country. Re-nationalising the railways and utilities will keep prices down, and private landlords will be prevented from exploiting their tenants. A vote for Labour is a vore for more cash in your pocket.

 - __Labour will save the NHS and invest in improving all public and emergency services.__ They have promised to end Conservative hospital closures, will put more police back on the beat and will ensure that our nurses get paid a decent wage. Labour will end the inefficient and expensive policy of selling off NHS and welfare contracts to private companies. 

 - __Labour will save our schools.__ A Labour government has committed to reinvesting in our schools across the country. This means that all children will get the high standard of teaching and learning that they deserve. Labour will provide free school meals to all children, and will ensure that our teachers and school staff are given the tools they need. This is an investment in the future of our country. 

 - __A sensible approach to Brexit.__ Labour will get the best deal for Britain, ensuring we maintain the benefits of the single market while forging a new path for our country. Labour’s approach will be based on cooperation and will focus on what is best for the many, not the few.
