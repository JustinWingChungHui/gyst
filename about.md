_**"Things can and they will change"**_

This stakes have rarely been higher in a UK general election. The Conservatives and Theresa May have overseen the biggest fall in living standards in living memory. There's a generation who will be worse off than their grandparents. Older people will lose their pensions. The NHS is being dismantled for profit.

Children are going hungry and families are being forced onto the street.

Our future is being auctioned off. And it’s up to us to save it. 

GYS*T came together as a group of people united by one simple belief; that we have a choice. We can choose to fight for a better, fairer future. We believe that the Labour party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, offers a compassionate and viable alternative to the cruelty of the current Conservative government.

**Labour is a party that represents the many rather than the few. And a party that works for the people.**

We know that we're fighting against the polls and against the odds - but we have to believe that there is some hope, and that we can all be a part of that hope.


> We don’t have to be unequal.  
> It does not have to be unfair.  
> Poverty isn’t inevitable.  
> Things can and they will change.  

Rt Hon Jeremy Corbyn
