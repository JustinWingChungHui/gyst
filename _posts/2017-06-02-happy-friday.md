Happy Friday friends! Just a friendly reminder that this time next week we could all be waking up to one of two futures.

I'm braced for the fact that I'll quite probably spend next Friday in tears. I'm genuinely terrified every time I think about what five more years of Tory government will mean for our country.

But. I'm also still full of hope.

I'm full of hope because of the incredible opportunity we have before us. I'm full of hope because, for the first time in my life - and I'd bet, yours - we have a chance to choose something different and better on election day.

I'm full of hope because we can make this happen. It is our future. And we can claim it.
There's a week to go until election day. Here are some things we can all do that can make a difference. A difference between five more years of cuts and cruelty or a chance for a better, fairer society. A difference between Labour winning and losing:

1) Talk to any of your friends who you think might not vote, or who don't see a difference between any of the main parties. Especially younger people. Turnout for 18-24s is usually around 40%. If you can persuade even one or two young people that there is a point in voting, that it matters for them and their future. We have a real chance at the ballot box. Student fees, home ownership, minimum wage, secure employment and the NHS - these things all affect younger voters. Make sure they know that they can make a difference.

2) Talk to your gran. Currently 64% of over-65s are set to vote Tory. If that fell by 5-10% any chance of them winning a majority would disappear. Tory policies on the winter fuel allowance, changes to the public pension and - of course - the dementia tax, mean they really have no reason to go blue. If you can convince even one person over 60 to switch their vote to another party - preferably Labour - then we have a real chance on election day. 

3) Get the vote out. On June 8th we need 100,000 people getting our vote out, ensuring that every single person who is thinking about voting Labour does. Our massive support base and membership is our biggest asset, so if possible, take the day off. To find out where you'll be most useful go to www.electiondaypledge.co.uk/pledge

4) Forward this message to your family, friends and colleagues. We can only win this election by pulling together and convincing as many people as possible that they can make a difference. If turnout is high, we have a real chance. We need to make sure it is.
If we get the vote out, especially among the young, and persuade enough older voters over the next week, Labour have every chance of being in power after June 8th. This is the future I want to wake up to next Friday.

Things are impossible, until they become inevitable. We can actually do this.
