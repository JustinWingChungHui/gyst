We're all voting Labour because we believe a better Britain is possible.
We're tired of being held back by a Conservative government that doesn't care about us.
Let's get our sh*t together and send out a message to the whole country. We're voting Labour!
Share your photo and tell us why you're voting Labour on 8th June.
