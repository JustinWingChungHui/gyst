The course is set on hope. We can win this. If we all play our own small part.

Read. Act. Share.

The polls show we can win if we can do three things:
- Convince the 18â€“35 age group that voting matters
- Convince people that money in your pocket; a home for your kids; and saving the NHS is more important than a cultural war against the EU, migrants and Muslims
- Convince voters over 60 that the Tories are bad for them and for their children and grandchildren

Be *that* guy... just this once...

- Talk to anyone who will listen. Make sure everyone who is registered to vote, does so on Thursday
- Send a message to all your friends on Facebook. Tell them how important this is
- Ask people if they've made up their minds about their vote? Ask if they care about the NHS? About their kids? About their parents?
- Talk to older people. Tell them about planned Tory cuts. Ask them if they have grandchildren.
