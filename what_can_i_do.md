We need to come together and fight to save our country. Our NHS, our welfare state, our children’s futures, our pensions and our schools. 

We’re asking you to do three things:

  1. __Make absolutely sure you are registered to vote.__ Changes in voter registration brought in by the Conservatives mean that nearly 1,000,000 people have dropped off the electoral register since December 2015, many of whom are unaware they are no longer eligible to vote. It takes five minutes to [register](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote) and the deadline is 22 May.

  2. __Make sure your family, friends and workmates are registered to vote.__ At the last General Election, more people did not vote at all than voted for any other party. If we can each persuade even one new person to vote for a better future, we can win this.  [Why Vote Labour?](/why_vote_labour/)

  3. __Vote Labour__. A vote for the Labour party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is a vote for something better. It’s a vote for change and a vote for hope. We need a government that works for the many rather than the few and that prioritises the needs of the people rather than the profits of its friends. This is our country and Labour is our party [Why Vote Labour?](/why_vote_labour/)



We need to win this. 

> Strong leadership is about standing up for the many, not the few

Jeremy Corbyn

And we can only win if we all come together and fight for what we believe in. We’ve got One Month to try and save our future.
