We need to come together and fight to save our country. Our NHS, our welfare state, our children’s futures, our pensions and our schools. 

We’re asking you to do three things:

  1. Make absolutely sure you are registered to vote. Changes in voter registration brought in by the Conservatives mean that nearly 1,000,000 people havewere dropped off the electoral register since December 2015, many of whom are unaware they are no longer eligible to vote. It takes five minutes to register [LINK to v registration] and the deadline is 22 May.

  2. Make sure your family, friends and workmates are registered to vote. At the last General Election, more people did not vote at all than voted for any other party. If we can each persuade even one new person to vote for a better future, we can win this. [Why should I vote labour LINK]

  3. Vote Labour. A vote for the Labour party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is a vote for something better. It’s a vote for change and a vote for hope. We need a government that works for the many rather than the few and that prioritises the needs of the people rather than the profits of its friends. This is our country and Labour is our party.

We need to win this.
